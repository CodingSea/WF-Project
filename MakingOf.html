                    <h2>Justification: Colors</h2>
                    <p>Since our topic is about technology and how it will change our world, we tried to find a color palette that suits the topic. In our research, we found that that that most programmers prefer dark theme in much higher rate, so we decided to. Additionally, we found that they use other colors like green because it is it fits the theme and is readable and it represents intelligence and hacking ability like in the movies, which makes them instantly establish credibility and authority with the user. So, we tried to make our color palette a green based one. </p>

                    <p>We started by making the project required of files we need to have, which was 6 HTML files and one folder for images, then we decided to make a shared CSS file that will have the base style elements for the navigation bar and logo and a personalized CSS file for each page. In addition, we created some JavaScript files, when necessary, one file was for registration and getting the username, the second was for the test which loads has question and checks if the answers are correct, and the final is to help with the makingOf page to improve it a bit.</p>
